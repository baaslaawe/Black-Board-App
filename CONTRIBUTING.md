## Setup
### Fork on GitHub
Before you do anything else, login/signup on GitHub and fork Black-Board-App from the GitHub project.

## Clone your fork locally
If you have git-scm installed, you now clone your git repo using the following command-line argument where <my-github-name> is your account name on GitHub.

## Issues!
Pick an unassigned issue that you think you can accomplish, add a comment that you are attempting to do it, and shortly your own personal label matching your GitHub ID will be assigned to that issue.

We love pull requests from everyone.
